    tools: ["read", "grep", "glob"]
    prompt: |
      Analyze target code and select techniques:
      - Numeric input ranges -> Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) + Equivalence Partitioning (EP)
      - Multiple conditions/business rules -> Decision Tables
      - Stateful workflows -> State Transition Testing
      - Many parameter combinations -> Pairwise Testing
      - All combinations critical -> Full Factorial
      Report which techniques apply and why.

  - name: boundary-value-analysis
    description: "Generate tests at boundaries: min, max, just below, just above."
    tools: ["edit", "bash", "mcp:agentic-qe:test_generate_enhanced"]
    prompt: |
      Apply Boundary Value Analysis:
      - Test at minimum valid value
      - Test just below minimum (invalid)
      - Test just above minimum (valid)
      - Test at maximum valid value
      - Test just above maximum (invalid)
      - Test just below maximum (valid)
      Generate test cases for each boundary identified.

  - name: equivalence-partitioning
    description: "Identify equivalent classes and generate one test per partition."
    tools: ["edit", "bash"]
    prompt: |
      Apply Equivalence Partitioning:
      - Identify valid and invalid partitions
      - Select one representative value from each partition
      - Generate one test per partition
      This reduces test count significantly while maintaining coverage.

  - name: decision-tables
    description: "Create decision tables for complex business rules with multiple conditions."
    tools: ["edit", "bash"]
    prompt: |
      Apply Decision Tables (if multiple conditions exist):
      - List all conditions and their possible values
      - List all possible actions/outcomes
      - Create the decision table with all rule combinations
      - Simplify by merging rules where condition does not affect outcome
      Generate one test per rule in the decision table.

  - name: pairwise-testing
    description: "Reduce combinatorial explosion using pairwise (all-pairs) testing."
    tools: ["edit", "bash"]
    prompt: |
      Apply Pairwise Testing (if many parameter combinations):
      - List all parameters and their values
      - Generate pairwise combinations where each pair appears at least once
      - This reduces tests from N^k (full factorial) to approximately N^2
      Example: 3 params x 3 values = 27 full -> 9 pairwise tests
