      Spawn parallel agents:
      1. qe-tdd-specialist — Verify TDD red-green-refactor cycle adherence
      2. qe-code-complexity — Analyze cyclomatic and cognitive complexity
      3. qe-coverage-specialist — Detect coverage gaps in new code
      Consume BDD scenarios from Refinement phase via memory.

    description: "Run AI-powered defect prediction on changed files to identify high-risk areas."
    tools: ["mcp:agentic-qe:defect_predict", "mcp:agentic-qe:coverage_analyze_sublinear"]
    prompt: |
      For each changed file in the sprint:
      1. Run defect prediction using historical patterns
      2. Cross-reference with coverage gaps
      3. Flag files exceeding complexity thresholds
      Output a prioritized risk report with SHIP/CONDITIONAL/HOLD recommendations.

    prompt: |
      Assess development quality:
      - Coverage meets sprint target (80%+ branch, 85%+ statement)
      - Complexity within thresholds
      - No critical defect predictions unaddressed
      Produce SHIP/CONDITIONAL/HOLD decision and store for CI/CD phase.
