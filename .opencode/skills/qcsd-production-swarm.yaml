description: "QCSD Production Telemetry phase swarm for post-release production health assessment using DORA metrics, root cause analysis, defect prediction, and cross-phase feedback loops. Consumes CI/CD outputs (RELEASE/REMEDIATE/BLOCK decisions, release readiness metrics) and produces feedback signals to Ideat"
