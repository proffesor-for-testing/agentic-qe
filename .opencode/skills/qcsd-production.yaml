      1. qe-metrics-optimizer — Collect and analyze DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, change failure rate)
      2. qe-defect-predictor — Analyze production incidents against pre-release predictions
      3. qe-root-cause-analyzer — Perform root cause analysis on production failures

      Analyze production data to generate feedback:
      1. Compare predicted defects vs actual incidents
      2. Identify quality criteria gaps from Ideation phase
      3. Identify BDD scenario gaps from Refinement phase
      4. Update risk models based on production outcomes
      Store feedback in memory for next Ideation cycle.
