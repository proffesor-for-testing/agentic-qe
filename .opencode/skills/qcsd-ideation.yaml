      Spawn parallel agents for quality criteria analysis:
      1. qe-quality-criteria-recommender — Apply HTSM v6.3 quality criteria matrix
      2. qe-risk-assessor — Run Risk Storming to surface hidden quality risks
      3. qe-requirements-validator — Validate requirements for testability
      Merge outputs into a unified Quality Criteria Report.

    prompt: |
      For each user story or feature under review:
      1. Index the relevant source code with code_index
      2. Run defect_predict on affected paths
      3. Score testability using multi-factor analysis
      Output a prioritized list of testing focus areas.

    prompt: |
      Combine quality criteria, risk assessment, and testability scores into:
      - Risk heat map (critical/high/medium/low)
      - Recommended test strategy per feature
      - Identified quality criteria for sprint acceptance
      Store the report in memory for the Refinement phase to consume.
