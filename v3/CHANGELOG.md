## [3.3.0] - 2026-01-24

### 🎯 Highlights

**Mathematical Coherence Verification** - ADR-052 introduces Prime Radiant WASM engines for mathematically-proven coherence checking. This is a major quality improvement that prevents contradictory test generation, detects swarm drift 10x faster, and provides formal verification for multi-agent decisions.

### Added

#### Coherence-Gated Quality Engineering (ADR-052)
- **CoherenceService** with 6 Prime Radiant WASM engines:
  - CohomologyEngine - Sheaf cohomology for contradiction detection
  - SpectralEngine - Spectral analysis for swarm collapse prediction
  - CausalEngine - Causal inference for spurious correlation detection
  - CategoryEngine - Category theory for type verification
  - HomotopyEngine - Homotopy type theory for formal verification
  - WitnessEngine - Blake3 witness chain for audit trails

- **Compute Lanes** - Automatic routing based on coherence energy:
  | Lane | Energy | Latency | Action |
  |------|--------|---------|--------|
  | Reflex | < 0.1 | <1ms | Immediate execution |
  | Retrieval | 0.1-0.4 | ~10ms | Fetch additional context |
  | Heavy | 0.4-0.7 | ~100ms | Deep analysis |
  | Human | > 0.7 | Async | Queen escalation |

- **ThresholdTuner** - Auto-calibrating energy thresholds with EMA
- **BeliefReconciler** - Contradiction resolution with 5 strategies (latest, authority, consensus, merge, escalate)
- **MemoryAuditor** - Background coherence auditing for QE patterns
- **CausalVerifier** - Intervention-based causal link verification
- **Test Generation Coherence Gate** - Block incoherent requirements before test generation

#### 4 New MCP Tools
- `qe/coherence/check` - Check coherence of beliefs/facts
- `qe/coherence/audit` - Audit QE memory for contradictions
- `qe/coherence/consensus` - Verify multi-agent consensus mathematically
- `qe/coherence/collapse` - Predict swarm collapse risk

#### CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow for coherence verification
- Shields.io badge generation (verified/fallback/violation)
- Automatic coherence checks on PR

### Changed

- **Strange Loop Integration** - Now includes coherence verification in self-awareness cycle
- **QEReasoningBank** - Pattern promotion now requires coherence gate approval
- **WASM Loader** - Enhanced with full fallback support and retry logic

### Fixed

- Fresh install UX now shows 'idle' status instead of alarming warnings
- ESM/CommonJS interop issue with hnswlib-node resolved
- Visual-accessibility workflow actions properly registered with orchestrator
- **DevPod/Codespaces OOM crash** - Test suite now uses forks pool with process isolation
  - Prevents HNSW native module segfaults from concurrent access
  - Limits to 2 parallel workers (was unlimited)
  - Added `npm run test:safe` script with 1.5GB heap limit

### Performance

Benchmark results (ADR-052 targets met):
- 10 nodes: **0.3ms** (target: <1ms) ✅
- 100 nodes: **3.2ms** (target: <5ms) ✅
- 1000 nodes: **32ms** (target: <50ms) ✅
- Memory overhead: **<10MB** ✅
- Concurrent checks: **865 ops/sec** (10 parallel)

## User Benefits

### For Test Generation
```typescript
// Before v3.3.0: Tests could be generated from contradictory requirements
const tests = await generator.generate(conflictingSpecs); // No warning!

// After v3.3.0: Coherence check prevents bad tests
const tests = await generator.generate(specs);
// Throws: "Requirements contain unresolvable contradictions"
// Returns: coherence.contradictions with specific conflicts
```

### For Multi-Agent Coordination
```typescript
// Mathematically verify consensus instead of simple majority
const consensus = await coherenceService.verifyConsensus(votes);

if (consensus.isFalseConsensus) {
  // Fiedler value < 0.05 indicates weak connectivity
  // Spawn independent reviewer to break false agreement
}
```

### For Memory Quality
```typescript
// Audit QE patterns for contradictions
const audit = await memoryAuditor.auditPatterns(patterns);

// Get hotspots (high-energy domains with conflicts)
audit.hotspots.forEach(h => {
  console.log(`${h.domain}: energy=${h.energy}, patterns=${h.patternIds}`);
});
```

### For Swarm Health
```typescript
// Predict collapse before it happens
const risk = await coherenceService.predictCollapse(swarmState);

if (risk.probability > 0.5) {
  // Weak vertices identified - take preventive action
  await strangeLoop.reinforceConnections(risk.weakVertices);
}
```
