# Getting Started with Agentic QE

*Your practical guide to beginning the journey from classical to agentic quality engineering*

---

## Before You Begin

Let me save you three months of pain: **Don't start with the agents.**

I know, I know. You're here for the AI stuff. But trust me—I tried jumping straight to agents. Twice. Both times ended with me apologizing to my team and rolling everything back.

Here's what you actually need first:

### Prerequisites Checklist

✅ **Classical QE Foundation**
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational (deployment < 1 day)
- [ ] Test automation (integration & e2e) > 40% coverage
- [ ] Production monitoring active
- [ ] Team owns quality (not just QA)
- [ ] Feedback loops established

✅ **Team Readiness**
- [ ] At least 2 champions identified
- [ ] Leadership support secured
- [ ] Learning time allocated (4 hours/week minimum)
- [ ] Failure tolerance agreed upon

✅ **Technical Foundation**
- [ ] Version control for all test code
- [ ] Test data management strategy
- [ ] Observability stack deployed (recommeded)
- [ ] API-first architecture (preferred, not required)

**Missing some?** Start there. Seriously. Agents amplify what exists—they don't fix what's broken.

## Your First 30 Days

### Week 1: Baseline and Learn

```yaml
day_1_3:
  morning:
    - Take the PACT assessment (honestly)
    - Document current pain points
    - Identify ONE problem to solve
  afternoon:
    - Set up measurement baseline
    - Define success metrics
    - Share plan with team

day_4_5:
  focus: "Education"
  actions:
    - Read the Framework documentation
    - Watch 2-3 implementation talks
    - Join the Agentic QE community
  avoid:
    - Buying tools yet
    - Making big announcements
    - Promising specific outcomes
```

### Week 2: First Agent Experiment

Start with the simplest, highest-value use case:

```python
# Your first agent - always start with assistance, not automation
class MyFirstAgent:
    """
    Week 2 Goal: AI-assisted test generation
    Tool: GitHub Copilot or similar
    Scope: One feature, one developer
    """
    
    def experiment_parameters(self):
        return {
            'duration': '1 week',
            'participants': '1-2 developers',
            'scope': 'Single feature or bug fix',
            'tool': 'AI code completion',
            'measurement': 'Before/after comparison',
            'fallback': 'Can disable instantly'
        }
```

**Real Result from Our First Week:**
- Test writing speed: 40% faster
- Test coverage: Discovered 3 edge cases we missed
- Developer reaction: "This is just fancy autocomplete"
- Week 2 reaction: "How did I work without this?"

### Week 3: Expand Carefully

```yaml
expansion_decision_tree:
  if: "Week 2 showed measurable improvement"
  then:
    - Add 2 more team members
    - Try second use case (log analysis)
    - Document learnings daily
  
  elif: "Week 2 had mixed results"
  then:
    - Continue with same scope
    - Adjust approach based on feedback
    - Seek external guidance
  
  else: "Week 2 failed"
    - Don't give up yet
    - Identify root cause
    - Try different tool or use case
    - Consider prerequisites again
```

### Week 4: Establish Patterns

By week 4, you should have:

1. **Working Rhythm**
   ```
   Monday: Review agent findings
   Wednesday: Adjust configurations
   Friday: Measure and share results
   ```

2. **Clear Boundaries**
   ```python
   agent_boundaries = {
       'can_do': ['Suggest', 'Analyze', 'Flag risks'],
       'cannot_do': ['Deploy', 'Delete', 'Override humans'],
       'needs_approval': ['Modify tests', 'Generate reports']
   }
   ```

3. **Feedback Loop**
   - Daily: Quick wins and blockers
   - Weekly: Metrics and adjustments
   - Monthly: Strategic review

## Choose Your Path

Based on your context, pick ONE path to start:

### Path A: The Debugger's Route
**Start with**: Log analysis and debugging assistance
**Best for**: Teams drowning in production issues
**First tool**: AI-powered log analyzer

```python
# Week 1: Baseline your debugging time
# Week 2: Introduce log analysis agent
# Week 3: Add correlation capabilities
# Week 4: Measure MTTR improvement
```

### Path B: The Tester's Route
**Start with**: Test generation and optimization
**Best for**: Teams with low test coverage
**First tool**: AI test generator

```python
# Week 1: Audit current test coverage
# Week 2: AI-assisted test writing
# Week 3: Automatic test maintenance
# Week 4: Measure coverage increase
```

### Path C: The Guardian's Route
**Start with**: Production monitoring and anomaly detection
**Best for**: Teams with stable systems needing better observability
**First tool**: Anomaly detection agent

```python
# Week 1: Baseline incident detection time
# Week 2: Deploy anomaly detection
# Week 3: Tune sensitivity
# Week 4: Measure false positive rate
```

## Common Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)

### Pitfall 1: "Let's Do Everything"
**Symptom**: Trying 5 different AI tools simultaneously
**Result**: Confusion, tool fatigue, no clear wins
**Fix**: One tool, one team, one month

### Pitfall 2: "The Agent Will Fix It"
**Symptom**: Deploying agents to broken processes
**Result**: Faster failure
**Fix**: Fix the process, then add agents

### Pitfall 3: "Trust Without Verification"
**Symptom**: Accepting all agent suggestions blindly
**Result**: Mysterious failures, team mistrust
**Fix**: Every agent decision needs human review (initially)

### Pitfall 4: "Secret Experiments"
**Symptom**: Not telling the team about agent usage
**Result**: Shadow IT, duplicated effort
**Fix**: Transparency from day one

## Your First Sprint Planning

Here's an actual sprint plan from our first month:

```markdown
## Sprint 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

### Goals
- Establish baseline metrics
- Get first agent operational
- Document initial learnings

### Stories
- As a developer, I want AI assistance for test writing (5 pts)
- As a team, we need baseline quality metrics (3 pts)  
- As a QE, I want to document agent decisions (2 pts)

### Success Criteria
- 10+ tests written with AI assistance
- Baseline metrics captured
- Decision log template created

### Risks
- Team resistance (Mitigation: Start with volunteers)
- Tool setup delays (Mitigation: Have backup option)
- No measurable improvement (Mitigation: Accept as learning)
```

---

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics from day one:

### Efficiency Metrics
```python
metrics = {
    'before_agents': {
        'test_creation_time': '2 hours per feature',
        'bug_discovery_time': '3 days average',
        'debugging_time': '4 hours per issue',
        'false_positive_rate': '30%'
    },
    'after_30_days': {
        'test_creation_time': 'Track daily',
        'bug_discovery_time': 'Track per sprint',
        'debugging_time': 'Track per incident',
        'false_positive_rate': 'Track weekly'
    }
}
```

### Quality Metrics
- Bugs escaped to production
- Test coverage percentage
- Mean time to resolution
- Customer-reported issues

### Team Metrics (Most Important!)
- Developer satisfaction
- Adoption rate
- Tool usage frequency
- Knowledge sharing instances

## Final Thought

The journey to Agentic QE isn't a sprint—it's not even a marathon. It's a continuous evolution. Start small, learn fast, fail safely, and scale what works.

You don't need to see the whole staircase. Just take the first step.

Welcome to the evolution.
