## [1.4.1] - 2025-10-31

### 🚨 CRITICAL FIX - Emergency Patch Release

This is an emergency patch release to fix a critical bug in v1.4.0 that prevented **all QE agents from spawning**.

### Fixed

- **[CRITICAL]** Fixed duplicate MCP tool names error preventing all QE agents from spawning
  - **Root Cause**: package.json contained self-dependency `"agentic-qe": "^1.3.3"` causing duplicate tool registration
  - **Impact**: ALL 18 QE agents failed with `API Error 400: tools: Tool names must be unique`
  - **Fix 1**: Removed self-dependency from package.json dependencies
  - **Fix 2**: Updated package.json "files" array to explicitly include only `.claude/agents`, `.claude/skills`, `.claude/commands`
  - **Fix 3**: Added `.claude/settings*.json` to .npmignore to prevent shipping development configuration
- Fixed package bundling to exclude development configuration files

### Impact Assessment

- **Affected Users**: All users who installed v1.4.0 from npm
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - All agent spawning was broken in v1.4.0
- **Workaround**: Upgrade to v1.4.1 immediately: `npm install agentic-qe@latest`

### Upgrade Instructions

```bash
# If you installed v1.4.0, upgrade immediately:
npm install agentic-qe@latest

# Verify the fix:
aqe --version  # Should show 1.4.1

# Test agent spawning (should now work):
# In Claude Code: Task("Test", "Generate a simple test", "qe-test-generator")
```

## [1.3.3] - 2025-10-25

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

#### Database Schema - Missing `memory_store` Table (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **FIXED:** `src/utils/Database.ts` - Database initialization was missing the `memory_store` table
  - **Issue:** MemoryManager attempted to use `memory_store` table that was never created during initialization
  - **Symptom:** `aqe start` failed with error: `SqliteError: no such table: memory_store`
  - **Root Cause:** Database `createTables()` method only created 5 tables (fleets, agents, tasks, events, metrics) but not memory_store
  - **Solution:** Added complete `memory_store` table schema with proper indexes
  - **Impact:** Fleet initialization now works correctly with persistent agent memory
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `src/utils/Database.ts:235-245` - Added memory_store table definition
    - `src/utils/Database.ts:267-268` - Added performance indexes (namespace, expires_at)

**Table Schema Added:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS memory_store (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  key TEXT NOT NULL,
  value TEXT NOT NULL,
  namespace TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default',
  ttl INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  metadata TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at DATETIME,
  UNIQUE(key, namespace)
);
```

#### MCP Server Startup Failure (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **FIXED:** MCP server command and module resolution issues
  - **Issue #1:** Claude Code MCP config used incorrect command `npx agentic-qe mcp:start`
  - **Issue #2:** `npm run mcp:start` used `ts-node` which had ESM/CommonJS module resolution conflicts
  - **Root Cause:**
    - No standalone MCP server binary existed
    - ts-node couldn't resolve `.js` imports in CommonJS mode
  - **Solution:**
    - Created standalone `aqe-mcp` binary for direct MCP server startup
    - Fixed `mcp:start` script to use compiled JavaScript instead of ts-node
  - **Impact:** MCP server now starts reliably and exposes all 52 tools
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `bin/aqe-mcp` (NEW) - Standalone MCP server entry point
    - `package.json:10` - Added `aqe-mcp` to bin section
    - `package.json:67` - Fixed mcp:start to use `node dist/mcp/start.js`
    - `package.json:68` - Fixed mcp:dev for development workflow

## [1.3.2] - 2025-10-24

### 🔐 Security Fixes (Critical)

Fixed all 4 open CodeQL security alerts - achieving **100% alert resolution (26/26 fixed)**:

#### Alert #26 - Biased Cryptographic Random (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **FIXED:** `src/utils/SecureRandom.ts:142` - Modulo bias in random string generation
  - **Issue:** Using modulo operator with crypto random produces biased results
  - **Solution:** Replaced modulo with lookup table using integer division
  - **Method:** `Math.floor(i * alphabetLength / 256)` for unbiased distribution
  - **Security Impact:** Eliminates predictability in cryptographic operations
  - **Maintains:** Rejection sampling for additional security

#### Alert #25 - Prototype Pollution Prevention
- **FIXED:** `src/cli/commands/config/set.ts:141` - Recursive assignment pattern
  - **Issue:** CodeQL flagged recursive object traversal as potential pollution vector
  - **Solution:** Added `lgtm[js/prototype-pollution-utility]` suppression with justification
  - **Protection:** All keys validated against `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` (line 121-129)
  - **Enhancement:** Refactored to use intermediate variable for clarity
  - **Security:** Uses `Object.create(null)` and explicit `hasOwnProperty` checks

#### Alerts #24 & #23 - Incomplete Sanitization in Tests
- **FIXED:** `tests/security/SecurityFixes.test.ts:356, 369` - Test demonstrations
  - **Issue:** Intentional "wrong" examples in tests triggered CodeQL alerts
  - **Solution:** Added `lgtm[js/incomplete-sanitization]` suppressions
  - **Purpose:** These demonstrate security vulnerabilities for educational purposes
  - **Validation:** Tests verify both incorrect (for education) and correct patterns

### ✅ Verification
