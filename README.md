## 🎯 Why AQE?

| Problem | AQE Solution |
|---------|--------------|
| **Writing comprehensive tests is tedious and time-consuming** | AI agents generate tests automatically with pattern reuse across projects |
| **Test suites become slow and expensive at scale** | Sublinear O(log n) algorithms for coverage analysis and intelligent test selection |
| **Flaky tests waste developer time debugging false failures** | ML-powered detection with root cause analysis and fix recommendations |
| **AI testing tools are expensive** | TinyDancer 3-tier model routing reduces costs by matching task complexity to appropriate model |
| **No memory between test runs—every analysis starts from scratch** | ReasoningBank remembers patterns, strategies, and what works for your codebase |
| **Agents waste tokens reading irrelevant code** | Code Intelligence provides token reduction with semantic search and knowledge graphs |
| **Quality engineering requires complex coordination** | Queen Coordinator orchestrates 50 agents across 12 domains with consensus and MinCut topology |
| **Tools don't understand your testing frameworks** | Works with Jest, Cypress, Playwright, Vitest, Mocha, Jasmine, AVA |

## 💻 V3 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Queen-Coordinated Quality Pipeline

```bash
claude "Use qe-queen-coordinator to run full quality assessment:
1. Generate tests for src/services/*.ts
2. Execute tests with parallel workers
3. Analyze coverage gaps with risk scoring
4. Run security scan
5. Validate quality gate at 90% threshold
6. Provide deployment recommendation"
```

**What happens:**
1. Queen spawns domain coordinators for each task
2. Agents execute in parallel across 5 domains
3. Results aggregate through memory coordination
4. Queen synthesizes final recommendation

### Example 2: Learning-Enhanced Test Generation

```bash
claude "Use qe-test-architect to create tests for PaymentService with:
- Property-based testing for validation
- 95% coverage target
- Apply learned patterns from similar services"
```

**Output includes:**
```
Generated 48 tests across 4 files
- unit/PaymentService.test.ts (32 unit tests)
- property/PaymentValidation.property.test.ts (8 property tests)
- integration/PaymentFlow.integration.test.ts (8 integration tests)
Coverage: 96.2%
Pattern reuse: 78% from learned patterns
Learning stored: "payment-validation-patterns" (confidence: 0.94)
```

### Example 3: TDD Workflow with Subagents

```bash
claude "Use qe-tdd-specialist to implement UserAuthentication with full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle"
```

**Workflow:**
1. **qe-tdd-red**: Writes failing tests defining behavior
2. **qe-tdd-green**: Implements minimal code to pass
3. **qe-tdd-refactor**: Improves code quality
4. **qe-code-reviewer**: Validates standards
5. **qe-security-reviewer**: Checks security concerns

### Example 4: Cross-Domain Coordination

```bash
claude "Coordinate security audit across the monorepo:
- qe-security-scanner for SAST/DAST
- qe-dependency-mapper for vulnerability scanning
- qe-contract-validator for API security
- qe-chaos-engineer for resilience testing"
```
