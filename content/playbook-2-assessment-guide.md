# Agentic QE Assessment Guide

*A comprehensive guide to assessing your organization's readiness and maturity for Agentic QE*

## Why Assessment Matters

"We need AI in our testing NOW!"

I hear this weekly. My response? "Show me your current testing first."

Because here's the truth: **Agentic QE amplifies what exists**. If you have chaos, you'll get faster chaos. If you have excellence, you'll get amplified excellence.

This assessment helps you understand:
- Where you are today
- What's possible tomorrow
- What to fix first
- Where agents will help most

## The PACT Assessment Framework

### How It Works

Each dimension is scored 0-100 based on current capabilities:

```python
class PACTAssessment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dimensions = {
            'Proactive': 0,      # Anticipation capabilities
            'Autonomous': 0,     # Independence level
            'Collaborative': 0,  # Team integration
            'Targeted': 0        # Focus and prioritization
        }
        
    def calculate_readiness(self):
        total = sum(self.dimensions.values())
        return {
            'score': total / 4,
            'level': self.determine_level(total / 4),
            'next_steps': self.recommend_actions(self.dimensions)
        }
```

## Creating Your Improvement Roadmap

Based on your assessment, here's how to build your roadmap:

```python
def create_roadmap(scores):
    roadmap = {
        'month_1': identify_quick_wins(scores),
        'month_2-3': strengthen_foundations(scores),
        'month_4-6': introduce_agents(scores),
        'month_7-9': scale_successes(scores),
        'month_10-12': measure_and_iterate(scores)
    }
    return roadmap

def identify_quick_wins(scores):
    # Focus on lowest hanging fruit
    weakest = min(scores, key=scores.get)
    return f"Improve {weakest} with basic tooling"

def strengthen_foundations(scores):
    # Build missing prerequisites
    if scores['Autonomous'] < 40:
        return "Increase automation coverage"
    elif scores['Collaborative'] < 40:
        return "Improve team integration"
    else:
        return "Enhance monitoring and feedback"
```

        self.baseline = initial_scores
        self.history = [initial_scores]
        
    def measure_improvement(self, current_scores):
        return {
            'absolute': self.calculate_absolute_change(current_scores),
            'percentage': self.calculate_percentage_change(current_scores),
            'trajectory': self.calculate_trajectory(),

## Common Assessment Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Over-Optimistic Scoring
**Symptom:** All scores > 60
**Reality Check:** If you're that good, why do you need help?
**Fix:** Have team members assess independently, use lowest scores

### Mistake 2: Gaming the System
**Symptom:** Adjusting answers to justify tool purchase
**Reality Check:** Agents amplify reality, not wishes
**Fix:** Use objective metrics, not subjective feelings

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Weak Dimensions
**Symptom:** Focusing only on high scores
**Reality Check:** Weakest link determines system strength
**Fix:** Address lowest scores first

### Mistake 4: One-Time Assessment
**Symptom:** Assess once, never revisit
**Reality Check:** Maturity evolves continuously
**Fix:** Quarterly reassessment minimum
