- [ ] Quality gate validation works (QualityGateAgent)
- [ ] Agent spawning works (BaseAgent)
- [ ] MCP handlers respond correctly
- [ ] CLI commands execute successfully
- [ ] Memory/neural systems function

**Risk**: HIGH - Widespread changes could break core features

### 3. Integration Regression (HIGH)

**Test Area**: Cross-component interactions

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Agent coordination still works
- [ ] MCP communication intact
- [ ] Memory sharing between agents
- [ ] Neural training pipeline
- [ ] CLI → Agent → MCP flow
- [ ] Streaming handlers work
- [ ] Swarm coordination active

**Risk**: MEDIUM - Integration points are fragile

### 4. Performance Regression (MEDIUM)

**Test Area**: Security fixes don't significantly slow down system

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] SecureRandom performance <1ms per call
- [ ] SecureValidation performance <0.1ms per check
- [ ] Build time unchanged (~8-10s)
- [ ] Test suite runtime reasonable
- [ ] Agent spawning latency acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage within limits

**Risk**: MEDIUM - Crypto operations could add overhead

### 5. Compatibility Regression (MEDIUM)

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Build passes (npm run build)
- [ ] All imports resolve
- [ ] Type definitions correct
- [ ] No dependency conflicts
- [ ] Package.json integrity
- [ ] Node version compatibility

**Risk**: LOW - Build is already passing

### 6. Documentation Regression (LOW)

**Test Area**: Documentation accuracy

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Security docs match implementation
- [ ] API examples work
- [ ] Migration guides accurate
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] README reflects changes

**Risk**: LOW - Documentation doesn't affect functionality

## Exploratory Test Charters

### Charter 1: Security Fix Verification Tour

**Mission**: Take a "security fix tour" through all modified files to verify fixes are present and correct.

**Heuristics to Apply**:
- **Goldilocks**: Is the fix just right? Not too strict, not too lenient?
- **Configuration**: What happens with edge case configs?
- **Consistency**: Are all instances fixed the same way?

**Tour Route**:
1. Start: `src/utils/SecureValidation.ts`
2. Verify: No eval(), no Function(), no code strings
3. Check: `src/reasoning/TestTemplateCreator.ts` - eval() removed?
4. Verify: `src/utils/SecureRandom.ts` - crypto module used?
5. Scan: All 72 files - Math.random() → SecureRandom?
6. Check: Shell commands - execFile used?
7. Verify: Test files - sanitization complete?
8. End: `tests/security/SecurityFixes.test.ts` - all tests pass?

### Charter 2: Agent Behavior Verification Tour

**Mission**: Test each agent type to ensure SecureRandom changes don't break core functionality.

**Agents to Test**:
- BaseAgent - spawning, lifecycle
- TestGeneratorAgent - test generation
- TestExecutorAgent - test execution
- CoverageAnalyzerAgent - coverage analysis
- QualityGateAgent - quality validation
- RegressionRiskAnalyzerAgent - risk assessment

**Test Pattern**:
```
For each agent:
1. Spawn agent
2. Execute core functionality
3. Verify output correct
4. Check for errors/warnings
5. Monitor performance
```

### Charter 3: MCP Handler Integration Tour

**Mission**: Verify all MCP handlers work correctly with SecureRandom.

**Handlers to Test**:
- quality-analyze - mock data generation
- test-execute - test orchestration
- fleet-status - metrics reporting
- predict-defects - risk scoring
- task-orchestrate - task distribution

**Test Pattern**:
```
For each handler:
1. Call handler via MCP
2. Verify response structure
3. Check data quality
4. Monitor for random ID collisions
5. Verify performance
```

### Charter 4: Edge Case Discovery Tour

**Mission**: Find edge cases in security utilities that might cause issues.

**SecureValidation Edge Cases**:
- Empty params object
- Null/undefined values
- Very long strings
- Unicode characters
- Nested objects
- Arrays vs objects
- Mixed types

**SecureRandom Edge Cases**:
- Zero-length ID generation
- Negative min/max bounds
- Min > max
- Very large arrays for shuffle
- Empty arrays for choice/sample
- Bias = 0 or bias = 1

**SecureUrlValidator Edge Cases**:
- Empty string
- Very long URLs (>2048 chars)
- International characters
- IPv6 addresses
- Localhost variants
- Port numbers
- Query params
- Fragments

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Automated Regression (30 min)

**Execution**:
```bash
# 1. Security test suite
npm test tests/security/SecurityFixes.test.ts

# 2. Full test suite
npm test

# 3. Build verification
npm run build

# 4. Lint check
npm run lint

# 5. Dependency audit
npm audit
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ 26/26 security tests pass
- ✅ All tests pass (or document failures)
- ✅ Build succeeds (0 errors)
- ✅ No lint errors
- ✅ 20/23 security issues resolved

### Phase 2: QE Agent Validation (30 min)

**Agents to Deploy**:

1. **qe-test-executor** - Run comprehensive test suite
2. **qe-coverage-analyzer** - Analyze test coverage gaps
3. **qe-quality-gate** - Validate quality standards
4. **qe-deployment-readiness** - Assess deployment risk

**Execution Pattern**:
```typescript
// Sequential execution with coordination
1. Execute tests → gather results
2. Analyze coverage → identify gaps
3. Validate quality → check standards
4. Assess readiness → risk score
```

### Phase 3: Exploratory Testing (30 min)

**Manual Verification**:

1. **Spot Check**: Randomly sample 10 modified files
   - Verify changes look correct
   - Check for obvious issues
   - Review code quality

2. **Integration Test**: Agent coordination flow
   - Spawn multiple agents
   - Verify memory sharing
   - Check neural coordination
   - Monitor performance

3. **Edge Case Hunt**: Find potential issues
   - Try unusual inputs
   - Test boundary conditions
   - Look for race conditions
   - Check error handling

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas

1. **Agent Random ID Generation**
   - Changed from Math.random() to SecureRandom
   - Risk: ID collisions if entropy is insufficient
   - Mitigation: Test with 10k+ agent spawns

2. **Validation Logic Changes**
   - Changed from eval() to declarative config
   - Risk: Validation behavior differs from original
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive validation tests

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - Crypto operations slower than Math.random()
   - Risk: Noticeable latency in high-volume ops
   - Mitigation: Performance benchmarks

### Medium Risk Areas

1. **Import Resolution**
   - Added 72+ new import statements
   - Risk: Circular dependencies, wrong paths
   - Mitigation: Build verification

2. **Type Safety**
   - New type definitions for ValidationConfig
   - Risk: Type mismatches in usage
   - Mitigation: TypeScript compilation check

### Low Risk Areas

1. **Documentation**
   - New docs created
   - Risk: Inaccuracies or outdated info
   - Mitigation: Manual review
