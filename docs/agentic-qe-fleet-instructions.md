### 14. Knowledge Curator Agent

#### Purpose
Maintain and evolve institutional testing knowledge, making it accessible and actionable.

#### Core Responsibilities
- Document testing patterns
- Maintain knowledge base
- Share relevant context
- Facilitate knowledge transfer

#### Implementation Instructions

```python
class KnowledgeCuratorAgent:
    """
    PACT Classification: Collaborative (Level 3)
    Proactive: Captures knowledge continuously
    Autonomous: Organizes knowledge independently
    Collaborative: Shares across teams
    Targeted: Organizational learning
    """
    
    def curate_knowledge(self, new_learning):
        categorized = self.categorize_learning(new_learning)
        validated = self.validate_with_existing(categorized)
        indexed = self.index_for_retrieval(validated)
        
        self.update_knowledge_base(indexed)
        self.notify_relevant_teams(indexed)
        
        return KnowledgeUpdate(indexed, recommendations)
```

#### Required Capabilities
1. **Knowledge Capture**
   - Pattern documentation
   - Heuristic recording
   - Lesson extraction
   - Context preservation

2. **Knowledge Organization**
   - Taxonomic classification
   - Semantic indexing
   - Relationship mapping
   - Version control

3. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Contextual retrieval
   - Proactive suggestions
   - Cross-project learning
   - Training material generation

#### Integration Points
- **Input**: Test results, patterns, incidents, team feedback
- **Output**: Knowledge articles, training materials, best practices
- **Dependencies**: Knowledge management systems, wikis, training platforms

#### Success Metrics
- Knowledge reuse rate > 60%
- Search effectiveness > 90%
- Cross-team learning instances
- Time to competency reduction

#### Development Notes
- Implement semantic search
- Use knowledge graphs for relationships
- Create learning paths
- Build feedback mechanisms

```

### Success Criteria

Each agent must meet these baseline criteria before production deployment:

1. **Explainability**: Every decision must have a traceable reasoning chain
2. **Performance**: Response time < 500ms for real-time agents
3. **Accuracy**: Domain-specific accuracy targets (defined per agent)
4. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for critical path agents
5. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capability
6. **Security**: Zero trust architecture compliance
7. **Observability**: Full telemetry and monitoring
8. **Human Override**: Manual intervention capability at all times

### Integration Patterns

```python
# Standard Agent Interface
class AgenticQEAgent(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def perceive(self, context: Context) -> Observation:
        """Gather information from environment"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def decide(self, observation: Observation) -> Decision:
        """Make decision based on observation"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def act(self, decision: Decision) -> Action:
        """Execute action based on decision"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def explain(self, action: Action) -> Explanation:
        """Provide reasoning for action taken"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def learn(self, feedback: Feedback) -> None:
        """Update internal model based on feedback"""
        pass
```
