# Agentic QE Framework Specifications

## Overview

The Agentic QE Framework extends Claude-Flow's agent orchestration capabilities with specialized Quality Engineering agents designed for comprehensive testing, risk assessment, and quality assurance across the software development lifecycle.

## Architecture Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Proactive Quality**: Agents anticipate and prevent issues rather than just detect them
2. **Continuous Learning**: Agents adapt based on historical patterns and outcomes
3. **Risk-Driven Testing**: Focus on high-impact areas identified by risk assessment
4. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Agents coordinate to provide comprehensive coverage
5. **Production-Aware**: Testing strategies informed by real production behavior

### Integration with Claude-Flow
- Leverages Claude-Flow's coordination topology (mesh, hierarchical, ring, star)
- Uses existing hooks system for pre/post operation coordination
- Extends memory management for quality metrics and risk patterns
- Integrates with neural training for pattern recognition and predictive analysis

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Hierarchical Coordination
```
Risk Oracle (Coordinator)
├── Exploratory Testing Navigator
├── Performance Sentinel
├── Security Auditor
└── Chaos Engineer
```

### Mesh Coordination
All agents share findings and coordinate testing strategies through shared memory and event broadcasting.

### Ring Coordination
Sequential handoff for comprehensive quality pipeline:
Requirements Explorer → TDD Pair Programmer → Security Auditor → Performance Sentinel → Deployment Guardian

### Star Coordination
Production Observer as central hub, coordinating with all other agents based on production insights.

## Memory Requirements

### Shared Memory Spaces
- `qe/risk-patterns`: Historical risk assessments and outcomes
- `qe/test-strategies`: Effective testing approaches by domain
- `qe/performance-baselines`: Performance benchmarks and trends
- `qe/security-threats`: Known vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies
- `qe/deployment-history`: Deployment outcomes and rollback triggers
- `qe/requirements-patterns`: Common ambiguity patterns and resolutions

### Agent-Specific Memory
Each agent maintains specialized knowledge bases for their domain expertise and learning patterns.

## Hooks Integration

### Pre-Task Hooks
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --agent-type qe --risk-assessment true
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "qe-swarm-${TASK_ID}"
```

### Post-Task Hooks
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --metrics-export qe
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks risk-update --findings "${FINDINGS_JSON}"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-sync --export-learning true
```

### Quality Gates
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks quality-gate --criteria coverage,security,performance
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks risk-threshold --level critical --block-deployment true
```
