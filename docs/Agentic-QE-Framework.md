# Agentic QE Framework

## 1. Core Definition
**Agentic Quality Engineering (Agentic QE)** = Quality Engineering infused with agentic principles (PACT: **Proactive, Autonomous, Collaborative, Targeted**), balancing classic QE practices with agent orchestration.

- From **testing-as-activity** → to **agents-as-orchestrators**.  
- From **verification theatre** → to **trusted, explainable flows**.  

---

## 2. Multi-Layer Architecture
- **Agents**: Specialized (functional-positive, functional-negative, security-injection, performance-planner). Operate like individual testers.  
- **Agentic Systems**: Orchestration layer, memory banks, feedback loops (the “testing orchestra”).  
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Verification + ethical approval checkpoints (no blind autonomy).  
- **Integration Layer**: CI/CD, observability, risk dashboards.  

---

## 3. Agentic Principles for QE
- **Autonomy** – Agents can self-execute test flows.  
- **Reactivity** – Detect regressions, anomalies, or performance drifts in real-time.  
- **Proactivity** – Anticipate risks via mutation testing, fault injection, forecast failures.  
- **Sociability/Collaboration** – Work with developers, ops, and other agents, explaining reasoning.

## 4. Bridging Classic QE
Classic principles from context-driven QE map neatly into agentic layers:
- **TDD / XP** → becomes agent-guided coding assistants.  
- **Exploratory Testing** → functional-negative agents exploring unknowns.  
- **CI/CD** → agent-driven regression flows.  
- **Chaos Engineering** → security & performance agents injecting failures.  
- **Context-driven QE** → PACT-driven orchestration: no universal solution, only contextual flows.  

---

## 5. Roadmap (Aligned to Strategy)
- **2025 Q4** – Define Agentic QE Framework v1 (articles + Sentinel proof).  
- **2026** – Expand with multi-agent testing modules (mutation testing, fault injection).  
- **2027–28** – Institutionalize → Certification, Balkan Summit, boutique consultancy.  

---

## 6. Key Differentiators
- **PACT-based classification** (like SAE levels for autonomy).  
- **Explainability-first** – every agent action comes with a reason trace.  
- **Hybrid human/agent workflow** – orchestration with oversight.  
- **Rust/Python multi-agent edge** – performance + resilience.
