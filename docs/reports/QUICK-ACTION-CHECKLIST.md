## üöÄ Phase 1: Vector Quantization (Week 1)

### Day 1: Configuration Setup
- [ ] Create `.agentic-qe/config/quantization.json`
  ```json
  {
    "quantization": {
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "scalar",
      "precision": 8,
      "calibration": "automatic"
    },
    "performance": {
      "cacheSize": 1000,
      "enableHNSW": true,
      "M": 16,
      "efConstruction": 200
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Update `src/core/memory/RealAgentDBAdapter.ts` to load config
- [ ] Add quantization initialization in AgentDB setup

### Day 2: Benchmarking
- [ ] Run baseline benchmarks (before quantization)
  ```bash
  npm run test:performance
  ```
- [ ] Document current metrics:
  - [ ] Memory usage: ___ MB
  - [ ] Search speed: ___ ms
  - [ ] Pattern accuracy: ___ %
- [ ] Enable quantization in dev environment
- [ ] Run benchmarks again (after quantization)
- [ ] Document improvements

### Day 3: Accuracy Testing
- [ ] Run pattern retrieval accuracy tests
  ```bash
  npm run test:integration -- pattern-retrieval
  ```
- [ ] Target: >98% accuracy maintained
- [ ] Run similarity search tests
  ```bash
  npm run test:integration -- similarity-search
  ```
- [ ] Target: >95% recall @ k=10
- [ ] Document any degradation

### Day 4: Large-scale Testing
- [ ] Generate 10K test patterns
  ```bash
  npm run generate:test-patterns -- --count 10000
  ```
- [ ] Test memory usage at scale
- [ ] Test search performance at scale
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks

### Day 5: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Update `docs/AGENTDB-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Add quantization section to `README.md`
- [ ] Create migration guide for existing users
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
- [ ] Deploy to production

## üé® Phase 2: Webapp Planning (Week 2)

### Design & Architecture
- [ ] Review Ruv's webapp gist for inspiration
- [ ] Create UI mockups (Figma/Sketch)
  - [ ] Agent fleet view
  - [ ] Test execution dashboard
  - [ ] Activity console
  - [ ] Quality metrics
- [ ] Define API contracts (OpenAPI spec)
- [ ] Setup project structure
  ```bash
  mkdir -p webapp/{frontend,backend}
  cd webapp/frontend
  npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
  ```

### Technology Decisions
- [ ] Confirm tech stack:
  - [ ] Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
  - [ ] State: Zustand
  - [ ] UI: shadcn/ui + Radix UI
  - [ ] Charts: Recharts
  - [ ] Realtime: SSE + socket.io
- [ ] Setup development environment
- [ ] Create initial components library

### User Research
- [ ] Identify 5-10 beta testers
- [ ] Share mockups for feedback
- [ ] Document feature priorities
- [ ] Adjust roadmap based on feedback
