# v3.6.14 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-02-20

## Highlights

Resolves DevPod OOM crashes during test execution and fixes CI artifact upload failures. Test suite now runs reliably in memory-constrained environments.

## Fixed

- **MCP unit test timeouts and DevPod OOM crashes** (#294, #251) — Mock `createTaskExecutor` at module level in domain-handlers and wrapped-domain-handlers tests to prevent real task execution. Reduced fleet init from ~31x to ~5x per test file via shared lifecycle management.
- **Vitest parallel execution causing memory exhaustion** — Changed `maxForks` to 1 and disabled `fileParallelism`. Added `bail: 3` to fail fast instead of accumulating OOM pressure.
- **CI artifact upload 403 Forbidden** (#294) — Added `actions: write` permission to workflow files for `upload-artifact@v4`.
- **Topology optimizer flaky convergence test** (#251) — Widened tolerance and added retry for probabilistic convergence assertion.
- **Test assertions using 128-dim instead of 768-dim** — Updated remaining test assertions to match 768-dim embedding vectors.
