# v3.7.5 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-03-01

## Highlights

The project structure has been flattened — v2 is archived and v3 is promoted to the root directory, eliminating the dual-package complexity. This release also adds RVF binary brain export and fixes native module crashes on unsupported platforms.

## Changed

- **Flat project structure** — v2 archived, v3 promoted to root. All source (`src/`, `dist/`, `tests/`) now lives at project root with a single `package.json`. The dual-package structure (`package.json` + `v3/package.json`) is gone, simplifying the build and publish pipeline.
- **Updated release workflow** — The `/release` skill has been rewritten for the single-package flat structure. No more `v3/` path references.
- **Updated CI workflow** — `npm-publish.yml` now verifies `dist/` at root (not `v3/dist/`)

## Added

- **RVF binary brain export** — Native `@ruvector/rvf-node` integration for exporting learning patterns to compact binary `.rvf` format. Enables efficient pattern serialization for transfer and backup.
- **Multi-platform coding agent support (carried from v3.7.4)** — 8 new platforms (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cline, Kilo Code, Roo Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Windsurf, Continue.dev) with `--with-all-platforms` flag, platform CLI commands, and 103 new tests.

## Fixed

- **@ruvector native module crashes** — Graceful fallback on platforms without native binaries, preventing hard crashes on module load (#314, #315)
- **Stale v3/ path references** — Cleaned up all leftover `v3/` references in source code post-flatten. Memory namespaces (`aqe/v3/domains/*`) are protected as database identifiers, not filesystem paths.
- **Release notes corrections** — Fixed alwaysAllow count from 21 to 22, removed stale plan references

## Migration Notes

- No user-facing API changes — the flatten is purely structural
- If you had local scripts referencing `v3/dist/`, update them to `dist/`
- Memory databases and namespaces are unchanged
