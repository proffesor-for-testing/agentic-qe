# v3.6.10 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-02-18

## Highlights

Completes the QCSD lifecycle with the Production Telemetry Swarm, adds eval-driven development tooling, and integrates Knowledge Graphs into test generation for smarter, faster test creation.

## Added

- **QCSD Production Telemetry Swarm** (#271) — 5th and final QCSD lifecycle phase collecting DORA metrics (deployment frequency, change failure rate, lead time, MTTR) via GitHub API. Includes auto-trigger workflow after npm publish and cross-phase memory hooks (Loop 5: CI/CD to Production).
- **Eval-driven development workflow** — `scripts/eval-driven-workflow.ts` for creating, running, and iterating on skill evaluations as the primary development loop.
- **Deterministic skill quality scorer** — `scripts/score-skill-quality.ts` computes reproducible quality scores for skills based on structure, coverage, and eval results.
- **Skill conflict detector** — `scripts/detect-skill-conflicts.ts` identifies overlapping skill scopes and trigger conflicts across the fleet.
- **Eval runner P1 grading improvements** — Negative control test cases (inverted pass logic), finding count enforcement, schema validation, weighted grading rubric (completeness/accuracy/actionability), and adaptive rubric with dynamic keyword extraction from prompts.
- **KG-assisted test generation** — Knowledge Graph integration into all test generators (Jest/Vitest, Mocha, Pytest) with mock declarations emitted from KG dependency analysis. Includes 276x faster HNSW vector loading.

## Fixed

- **Self-learning hooks not recording from CLI** — Hook interactions from CLI commands were silently dropped. All CLI hook interactions now record learning data correctly.

## Security

- **Dependency updates** (#272) — Bumped `tar` 7.5.7 to 7.5.9 (symlink path traversal fix) and `ajv` 8.17.1 to 8.18.0 (CVE-2025-69873 ReDoS mitigation).
