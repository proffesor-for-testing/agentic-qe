# v3.6.16 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-02-21

## Highlights

Adds Node.js built-in test runner (`node:test`) as a 5th supported framework, introduces smart assertions that infer test expectations from function names and return types, and fixes 12 bugs found during devil's advocate review.

## Added

- Node.js `node:test` runner generator — zero-dependency testing on Node.js 18+
- Smart assertions based on function name prefixes and return types across all generators
- Destructured parameter handling for `({ a, b })` and `([x, y])` patterns

## Fixed

- `convertToAssert()` double-lambda bug silently passing all error tests
- Regex ordering producing garbled assert output for array/typeof checks
- Missing `toBeInstanceOf` conversion in node:test generator
- Unconverted `expect()` calls in boundary test action fields
- `is`/`has`/`can` prefix false positives (e.g., `isolate`, `issue`)
- Mocha and Pytest missing `#` private method filter
- `node-test` missing from task executor, CLI wizard, completions, MCP tools

## Changed

- Smart assertions now apply to class method tests (previously standalone functions only)
- Factory test suite covers all 5 frameworks in integration tests
