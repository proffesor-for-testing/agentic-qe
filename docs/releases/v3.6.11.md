# v3.6.11 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-02-18

## Highlights

Resolves 9 GitHub issues (#274-#282) with MCP stability improvements, multi-language support across all CLI commands, smarter `aqe init --auto` that preserves user hooks, and improved metric accuracy.

## Added

- **Smart settings merge for `aqe init --auto`** — Detects existing AQE hooks and updates in-place instead of duplicating. Non-AQE user hooks are preserved.
- **Multi-language file discovery** — Shared utility supporting 12+ languages used by all CLI commands (code, coverage, security, test).
- **Accuracy indicator on metrics** (#281) — `ProjectMetrics.accuracy` field tells consumers whether counts are from real file analysis or estimation.

## Fixed

- **MCP server crash on malformed requests** (#274) — Structured error responses instead of killing the connection.
- **`code_index` hardcoded to JS/TS** (#275) — All CLI commands now discover files across 12+ languages.
- **Coverage handler synthetic file paths** (#276) — Only real file paths returned, no more `src/module0.ts` placeholders.
- **HNSW vector dimension mismatch panic** (#277) — Auto-resizes vectors instead of crashing.
- **Model router negative scores** (#278) — Fixed scoring edge cases with proper floors and thresholds.
- **LOC counter accuracy** (#281) — Expanded exclude dirs, added safety guards, renamed source to `node-native`.
- **Init wizard hooks** — Added missing `--json` flags, MCP server name migration from `aqe` to `agentic-qe`.

## Changed

- **Cross-language security scanning** in test generation for non-JS/TS files.
- **Model routing enrichment** — MCP handlers now infer domain and criticality from task descriptions.
