# v3.6.5 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-02-13

## Highlights

Fixes `fleet_init` crash caused by vector dimension mismatch (#255), restores correct learning persistence in all 48 agent templates, and corrects 13 incorrect CLI commands in README documentation.

## Fixed

- **Vector dimension mismatch (#255)** — `fleet_init` crashed with `Vector length mismatch: 128 vs 768` because QE domain HNSW indices were hardcoded to 128-dim while the embedding system produces 768-dim vectors. All 6 QE domain HNSW configs now derive dimensions from `EMBEDDING_CONFIG.DIMENSIONS` (768). Coverage-analysis HNSW (128-dim custom feature vectors) remains unchanged.
- **Agent asset learning protocol** — 48 agent templates had broken learning persistence: wrong namespace, missing `persist: true`, and malformed key formats. Synced all assets from the correct committed definitions.
- **README CLI commands** — Fixed 13 commands referencing non-existent flags/subcommands (e.g., `aqe init --wizard`, `aqe memory search`, `aqe hooks intelligence`, `aqe coordination consensus`).

## Changed

- **CLAUDE.md init template** — Now includes comprehensive MCP tool usage instructions with correct `mcp__agentic-qe__` prefix and full tool reference table.
- **README MCP setup flow** — Clarified that `aqe init --auto` configures `.mcp.json` automatically for Claude Code auto-start.
