# v3.6.3 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-02-11

## Highlights

QX Analysis bridges QA and UX, SFDIPOT product factors assessment, and full cross-platform compatibility.

## Added

- **QX (Quality Experience) Analysis Tool** — New MCP tool `qe/analysis/qx_analysis` bridging QA and UX by analyzing user journeys, experience impact, and quality-experience correlation.
- **SFDIPOT Product Factors Assessment** — `qe-product-factors-assessor` agent implementing James Bach's HTSM v6.3 framework for comprehensive test strategy generation.

## Fixed

- **Cross-platform compatibility** — Replaced all bash-only `.sh` scripts with cross-platform Node.js (`.cjs`) equivalents. Windows, macOS, and Linux now fully supported for skill validation, daemon management, and project initialization.
- **Stop hook hanging on exit** — Session-end hook no longer initializes the full database/HNSW/memory system just to print shutdown stats. Added `unref()` to all cleanup intervals so Node.js process exits cleanly.
- **Cross-platform daemon scripts** — `start-daemon.cjs` and `stop-daemon.cjs` replace bash scripts, using `process.kill()` and `spawn()` with `detached: true` for portable process management.
- **TypeScript shell type in execSync** — Fixed `ExecSyncOptionsWithStringEncoding` overload conflict by using platform-specific shell string instead of `shell: true` boolean.
- **Tunnel manager test stability** — Pre-spawn port availability check prevents flaky failures from port conflicts.

## Changed

- **QE agents use only AQE MCP** — All 46 QE agent definitions now reference `agentic-qe` MCP tools exclusively, removing any Claude Flow MCP dependencies.
- **Skill validation is now declarative** — `validate-config.json` + `validate-skill.cjs` replaces all 104 `validate.sh` scripts. Validators are fully cross-platform with no bash dependency.
- **Registry tool count** — MCP tool registry updated from 32 to 33 tools to include QX Analysis.
