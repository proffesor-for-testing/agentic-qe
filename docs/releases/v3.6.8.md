# v3.6.8 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-02-15

## Highlights

MCP server now works out of the box — fleet auto-initializes on startup, experience learning is unified, and missing runtime dependencies are resolved.

## Fixed

- **MCP tools failing with "Fleet not initialized"** — Every MCP tool call required a prior `fleet_init` call, which Claude Code doesn't do automatically. Fleet now auto-initializes on MCP server startup with default configuration (hierarchical topology, hybrid memory).
- **Experience persistence gap** — Learning system (`ExperienceReplay`) read from a separate `experiences` table while the capture middleware wrote to `captured_experiences`, so new experiences were never visible to the learning system. Unified to use `captured_experiences` as the single source of truth.
- **Split-brain database from relative dbPath** — `UnifiedMemoryManager` accepted relative paths which could create duplicate databases when CWD differed from project root. Now resolves relative paths through `findProjectRoot()`.
- **Missing runtime dependency `fast-json-patch`** (#262) — Package was marked as external in the MCP esbuild bundle but not listed in root `package.json`, causing `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on fresh installs. Added `fast-json-patch` and `jose` to root dependencies.

## Changed

- **Data migrator** — v2-to-v3 migration now writes to `captured_experiences` table instead of the removed `experiences` table.
