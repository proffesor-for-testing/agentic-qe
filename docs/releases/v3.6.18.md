# v3.6.18 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-02-21

## Highlights

Agent Teams (ADR-064) are now fully accessible via MCP with 6 new tools for team management, messaging, and scaling, plus enriched agent and fleet responses with team context.

## Added

- **6 new Agent Teams MCP tools** — `team_list`, `team_health`, `team_message`, `team_broadcast`, `team_scale`, `team_rebalance` expose domain team management via MCP
- **Team membership in agent_list** — Each agent now shows its team role (`lead` or `teammate`) and team size
- **Teams summary in fleet_status** — Fleet status includes active teams count, total agents in teams, and healthy team count
- **Auto-team-wiring on agent spawn** — Agents are automatically registered in domain teams when spawned (first = lead, rest = teammates)
- **addTeammate() on DomainTeamManager** — Add real agent IDs as teammates instead of synthetic IDs
- **Runtime message-type validation** — Invalid message types are rejected with clear error messages

## Fixed

- **Race condition in parallel agent spawns** — Two concurrent spawns no longer cause ghost agents; create-team failure falls back to addTeammate
- **Duplicate agent guard** — addTeammate rejects agents already in the team, preventing corrupted team size calculations
