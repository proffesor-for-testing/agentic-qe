# v3.6.12 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2026-02-19

## Highlights

Fixes 5 user-reported issues (#284-#288) that caused MCP crashes, fake scan results, and missing hook infrastructure. The HNSW dimension mismatch that killed MCP connections is permanently resolved.

## Fixed

- **HNSW native crash on dimension mismatch** (#284, #285) — All 13 source files corrected from 128 to 768 dimensions. Added dimension guard that safely skips mismatched vectors instead of crashing.
- **Security scan returned fake findings** (#287) — Complete rewrite to scan real files with 40+ SAST patterns. Now checks .github, .docker, .aws directories and dependency vulnerabilities.
- **Coverage XML parser missing** (#286) — Added Cobertura XML parser. Fixed secret detection to find multiple matches per line. Broadened CORS detection to 5 frameworks.
- **Fake MCP handlers replaced** (#286) — 6 stub handlers now provide real implementations or honest guidance.
- **Init hooks directory missing** (#288) — `aqe init --auto` now creates `.claude/hooks/` with real infrastructure assets.
- **Dangerous uncaughtException handler removed** — Protocol server no longer masks errors with a catch-all handler.
