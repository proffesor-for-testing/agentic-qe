NOTE Video: Audi Q3 Sportback TFSI e Exterior Walkaround

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
SCENE: Dramatic close-up of the front corner of a glacier white
Audi Q3 Sportback. The camera is positioned low, looking up at
the vehicle's front fascia. The Matrix LED headlight dominates
the frame - a sharp, angular unit with LED segments illuminated
in bright white. Below, the octagonal Singleframe grille features
a dark honeycomb mesh pattern with gloss black surrounds. A large
vertical air intake sits beside the grille with geometric patterns.
The front wheel shows a multi-spoke alloy design. Background shows
a modern building with white and dark grey panels, and green
foliage from mature trees.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
SCENE: Rear three-quarter view showing the distinctive Sportback
silhouette. The glacier white vehicle is parked on light grey
paving stones. A full-width LED light bar connects the tail lights,
with the illuminated four-ring Audi logo centered on the tailgate.
The light bar glows red with segmented patterns. Below, a German
license plate reads "IN-Q 307 E" - the IN indicating Ingolstadt
registration. A chrome "Q3" badge sits left of the plate. The
rear bumper features a dark grey honeycomb diffuser insert and
chrome-tipped exhaust surrounds. Black wheel arch trim frames
the rear wheel. A large deciduous tree with full green canopy
fills the background against a pale grey sky.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
SCENE: Artistic detail shot of the B-pillar and rear quarter
window area. The camera captures the glossy black piano lacquer
trim that runs from the roof down through the door frames. White
text reading "Audi" appears on the left B-pillar in the brand's
signature font. On the right C-pillar, "Q3 Sportback" is written
in white, identifying this as the coupe-styled variant. The tinted
rear quarter window shows reflections of trees and sky - silhouettes
of branches and leaves are visible in the dark glass. The white
body paint meets the black trim in a clean horizontal line. This
detail emphasizes the premium finish and Sportback-specific design
elements that distinguish this model.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
SCENE: Final establishing shot showing the Q3 Sportback in its
environmental context. The vehicle's coupe-like roofline slopes
elegantly toward the rear, creating the signature Sportback
silhouette. The glacier white metallic paint reflects ambient
light, creating subtle highlights along the sculpted body panels.
The modern architectural backdrop features clean minimalist design
with white rendered walls and dark window frames, complementing
the vehicle's premium positioning. The scene conveys sophistication
and contemporary luxury appropriate for the Audi brand.
