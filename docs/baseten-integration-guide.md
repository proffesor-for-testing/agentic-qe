## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Pilot Program (Month 1-2)

#### 1.1 Select Pilot Agent
Choose one high-impact agent for initial implementation:
- **Recommended**: `functional-negative` or `performance-analyzer`
- **Rationale**: Rich historical data, measurable impact

#### 1.2 Data Collection
```python
# Training data sources
training_data = {
    "test_results": "Historical test execution logs",
    "bug_reports": "Jira/GitHub issues with root causes",
    "code_reviews": "PR comments and suggestions",
    "api_specs": "OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas",
    "performance_logs": "APM metrics and traces"
}
```

#### 1.3 Initial Training
```bash
# Example training configuration
baseten train \
  --model-size 7B \
  --base-model llama-2-7b \
  --dataset ./qe-training-data \
  --epochs 10 \
  --learning-rate 2e-5
```

#### 1.4 Performance Comparison
- Baseline: Current Claude/GPT performance
- Metrics: Accuracy, latency, cost, domain relevance
- A/B testing: Run both models in parallel

### Phase 2: Specialized Models (Month 3-4)

#### 2.1 Agent-Specific Models

```yaml
Training Pipeline:
  1. Data Preparation:
     - Format: JSONL with prompt-completion pairs
     - Volume: Minimum 10,000 examples per agent
     - Quality: Validated and deduplicated

  2. Model Selection:
     Base Models:
       - Text Generation: Llama-2, Mistral
       - Code Understanding: CodeLlama, StarCoder
       - Classification: BERT variants

  3. Fine-tuning Strategy:
     - LoRA for efficient training
     - Multi-task learning for shared knowledge
     - Continuous pre-training for domain adaptation
```

#### 2.2 Chain Development

Create specialized chains for complex workflows:

```python
# Example: Test Generation Chain
class TestGenerationChain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.spec_analyzer = BastenModel("spec-analyzer-v1")
        self.test_generator = BastenModel("test-gen-v1")
        self.validator = BastenModel("test-validator-v1")

    async def generate_tests(self, api_spec):
        # Step 1: Analyze specification
        analysis = await self.spec_analyzer.analyze(api_spec)

        # Step 2: Generate test cases
        tests = await self.test_generator.generate(
            spec=api_spec,
            analysis=analysis
        )

        # Step 3: Validate and refine
        validated = await self.validator.validate(tests)

        return validated
```

### Phase 3: Full Integration (Month 5-6)

#### 3.1 Complete Agent Fleet

Deploy custom models for all agents:

```yaml
Agent Fleet Configuration:
  specification-agent:
    model: "baseten/qe-spec-analyzer-v1"
    endpoint: "https://api.baseten.co/spec-analyzer"

  functional-positive:
    model: "baseten/qe-positive-test-v1"
    endpoint: "https://api.baseten.co/positive-test"

  functional-negative:
    model: "baseten/qe-negative-test-v1"
    endpoint: "https://api.baseten.co/negative-test"

  security-auth:
    model: "baseten/qe-security-v1"
    endpoint: "https://api.baseten.co/security"

  performance-analyzer:
    model: "baseten/qe-performance-v1"
    endpoint: "https://api.baseten.co/performance"
```

#### 3.2 Continuous Learning Pipeline

```python
# Automated retraining pipeline
class ContinuousLearning:
    def collect_feedback(self):
        # Gather test results, bug reports, user feedback
        pass

    def prepare_training_data(self):
        # Format and validate new training examples
        pass

    def retrain_model(self):
        # Incremental training with new data
        pass

    def validate_improvement(self):
        # Ensure model performance hasn't degraded
        pass

    def deploy_if_better(self):
        # Automatic deployment with rollback capability
        pass
```

  "prompt": "Generate negative test cases for POST /api/users endpoint with schema: {name: string, age: number}",
  "completion": {
    "test_cases": [
      {
        "name": "Missing required field",
        "payload": {"age": 25},

## Integration Architecture

### 1. Hybrid Approach

Combine Baseten custom models with existing LLMs:

```python
class HybridAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.custom_model = BastenModel("domain-specific")
        self.general_llm = ClaudeAPI()

    async def process(self, task):
        # Use custom model for domain-specific tasks
        if task.is_domain_specific():
            return await self.custom_model.predict(task)

        # Fall back to general LLM for complex reasoning
        return await self.general_llm.complete(task)
```

### 2. Agent Orchestration

```yaml
Orchestration Flow:
  1. Task Reception:
     - SPARC coordinator receives testing request

  2. Agent Selection:
     - Route to appropriate specialized agent

  3. Model Invocation:
     - Agent uses Baseten model for domain tasks
     - Falls back to Claude for complex reasoning

  4. Result Aggregation:
     - Combine outputs from multiple agents
     - Validate and format results

  5. Feedback Loop:
     - Collect performance metrics
     - Queue for retraining pipeline
```

### 3. API Integration

```python
# Baseten client wrapper
class BastenQEClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.client = baseten.Client(api_key)
        self.models = self.load_models()

    async def generate_test(self, agent_type, context):
        model = self.models[agent_type]
        response = await model.predict(
            prompt=self.format_prompt(context),
            max_tokens=2048,
            temperature=0.3
        )
        return self.parse_response(response)
```
