# Test Reporting & Analytics

## Core Principle

**Measure to improve. Report to communicate.**

Test reporting transforms raw test data into actionable insights. Analytics enable data-driven quality decisions.

## Key Metrics

### Test Execution Metrics
- Pass/Fail rate
- Flaky test percentage
- Execution time (total, per test)
- Test coverage (code, requirements)

### Quality Metrics
- Defect density
- Defect detection rate
- Escaped defects
- Mean time to detect (MTTD)
- Mean time to resolve (MTTR)

### Efficiency Metrics
- Automation rate
- Test maintenance cost
- ROI of automation
- Velocity (features tested/sprint)

## Dashboards

**Real-Time Quality Dashboard:**
```
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| Tests Passed     | Code Coverage    | Flaky Tests      |
| 1,247 / 1,250    | 82.3%           | 1.2%            |
| 99.76% ✅       | ⬆️ +2.1%        | ⬇️ -0.3%        |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+

+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| Critical Bugs    | Test Velocity    | Deploy Freq     |
| 0 open           | 47 tests/sprint  | 12x/day         |
| ✅              | ⬆️ +5           | ⬆️ +2x          |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+

## Trend Analysis

```javascript
// Identify trends
const testResults = await fetchTestResults(30); // 30 days

const trend = analyzeTrend(testResults, 'passRate');
if (trend === 'declining') {
  alert('⚠️ Test pass rate declining for 7 days');
}

const coverage = analyzeTrend(testResults, 'coverage');
if (coverage === 'stagnant') {
  alert('ℹ️ Code coverage unchanged. Add tests for new code.');
}
```

## Predictive Analytics

```typescript
// Predict test failures
const prediction = await agent.predictTestFailures({
  historicalData: testResults,
  codeChanges: prDiff,
  teamMetrics: velocityData
});

// Returns:
// {
//   probabilityOfFailure: 0.73,
//   likelyFailingTests: ['payment.test.ts', 'checkout.test.ts'],
//   suggestedAction: 'Review payment module changes carefully',
//   confidence: 0.89
// }
```

## Executive Reporting

**Monthly Quality Report:**
```markdown
## Quality Report - October 2025

### Executive Summary
✅ Production: 99.97% uptime (target: 99.95%)
✅ Deployment: 12x/day (up from 8x/day)
⚠️ Test Coverage: 82.3% (target: 85%)

### Key Achievements
- Reduced flaky tests from 3.2% to 1.2%
- Automated 47 new tests (95% automation rate)
- 0 critical bugs escaped to production

### Action Items
- Increase coverage for new payment module
- Address 3 long-running flaky tests
- Train team on performance testing

### ROI
- Automation saves 120 hours/month
- Bug detection cost: $150/bug vs $5,000 in production
- Estimated annual savings: $450k

## Remember

**Track metrics to improve quality.**

Report:
- Test results (pass/fail trends)
- Code coverage (gaps and trends)
- Flaky test rate (reliability)
- Defect metrics (escaped bugs)
- ROI of testing (business value)

**Make data actionable, not just visible.**

**With Agents:** `qe-quality-analyzer` aggregates metrics, generates insights, predicts trends, and creates executive reports automatically.
