# Shift-Left Testing

## Core Principle

**Finding bugs earlier reduces cost by 10x-100x.**

Shift-left testing moves testing activities earlier (left on timeline) in software development lifecycle. The earlier you test, the cheaper bugs are to fix and the faster you can deploy.

## What is Shift-Left Testing?

**Shift-Left:** Moving testing activities earlier (left on timeline) in software development lifecycle.

**Traditional (Shift-Right):**
```
Requirements → Design → Code → Test → Deploy
                                  ↑
                         Testing happens here (late, expensive)
```

**Shift-Left:**
```
Requirements → Design → Code → Deploy
     ↓          ↓        ↓
   Test      Test     Test  (continuous, cheap)
```

**Benefits:**
- 10x-100x cost reduction (bugs found early)
- Faster feedback (minutes vs days)
- Better quality (built-in vs bolted-on)
- Confident deployments (continuous validation)

## Shift-Left Strategies

### Level 1: Traditional Testing

- Testing after development complete
- Separate QA phase
- Manual testing dominant
- Waterfall approach

**Cost of Bug:** $1,000-10,000

---

### Level 2: Shift-Left (Unit Tests)

- Developers write unit tests
- TDD practices
- Automated unit tests in CI
- Test coverage metrics

**Cost of Bug:** $100-1,000 (10x cheaper)

```javascript
// Developer writes test BEFORE code (TDD)
test('calculateTotal sums line items', () => {
  const items = [{ price: 10 }, { price: 20 }];
  expect(calculateTotal(items)).toBe(30);
});

// Then implements code
function calculateTotal(items) {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}
```

**TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor):**
1. **Red**: Write failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality

---

### Level 3: Shift-Further-Left (Requirements)

- Testable acceptance criteria
- BDD with Gherkin scenarios
- Executable specifications
- Test cases from requirements

**Cost of Bug:** $10-100 (100x cheaper)

```gherkin
# Specification IS test
Feature: Shopping Cart

Scenario: Calculate total with tax
  Given I have items worth $100
  When I apply 10% tax
  Then the total should be $110
```

**BDD Benefits:**
- Business stakeholders write tests
- Living documentation
- Automated acceptance testing
- Shared understanding

**Tools:** Cucumber, SpecFlow, Behave

---

### Level 4: Shift-All-The-Way-Left (Design)

- Testability in architecture
- Design for testability
- API design reviewed for testing
- Security/performance considered early

**Cost of Bug:** $1-10 (1000x cheaper)

```typescript
// Design decision: Dependency injection for testability
class OrderService {
  constructor(
    private paymentGateway: PaymentGateway,  // Injectable
    private emailService: EmailService       // Mockable
  ) {}

  // Easy to test with mocks
  async placeOrder(order: Order) {
    await this.paymentGateway.charge(order.total);
    await this.emailService.sendConfirmation(order);
  }
}

// Test with mocks (no real payment gateway needed)
test('places order successfully', async () => {
  const mockPayment = { charge: jest.fn() };
  const mockEmail = { sendConfirmation: jest.fn() };

  const service = new OrderService(mockPayment, mockEmail);
  await service.placeOrder({ total: 100 });

  expect(mockPayment.charge).toHaveBeenCalledWith(100);
  expect(mockEmail.sendConfirmation).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

**Design Patterns for Testability:**
- Dependency Injection
- Interface-based design
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Avoid global state
- Pure functions (no side effects)

## Continuous Testing in CI/CD

### CI/CD Pipeline with Shift-Left Testing

**Goal:** Test at every stage, fail fast, high confidence

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Shift-Left Testing Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  # Stage 1: Fast Feedback (< 5 minutes)
  fast-feedback:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Static Analysis (30 seconds)
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Type Check
        run: npm run type-check

      # Unit Tests (2 minutes)
      - name: Unit Tests
        run: npm run test:unit

      - name: Coverage Check
        run: npm run coverage -- --threshold 80

  # Stage 2: Integration Tests (< 10 minutes)
  integration-tests:
    needs: fast-feedback
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Integration Tests (5 minutes)
      - name: Integration Tests
        run: npm run test:integration

      # Security Scanning (3 minutes)
      - name: Security Scan
        run: npm audit && npm run security:scan

  # Stage 3: E2E Tests (< 15 minutes)
  e2e-tests:
    needs: integration-tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # E2E Tests (10 minutes)
      - name: E2E Tests with Playwright
        run: npm run test:e2e

      # Performance Tests (5 minutes)
      - name: Performance Tests
        run: npm run test:performance

  # Stage 4: Deploy to Staging
  deploy-staging:
    needs: e2e-tests
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        run: ./deploy.sh staging

      # Smoke Tests on Staging
      - name: Smoke Tests
        run: npm run test:smoke -- --env=staging
```

**Pipeline Best Practices:**
1. **Fail Fast**: Run fastest tests first (lint, unit)
2. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent tests concurrently
3. **Clear Feedback**: Immediate notification on failures
4. **Incremental Testing**: Only run affected tests when possible
5. **Quality Gates**: Block merges on test failures

## Test Pyramid (Shift-Left Strategy)

```
        /\
       /E2E\         Few (slow, expensive, brittle)
      /------\
     /  Int.  \      Some (moderate speed/cost)
    /----------\
   /    Unit    \    Many (fast, cheap, reliable)
  /--------------\
```

**Unit Tests (Base):**
- 70-80% of tests
- Milliseconds execution
- Test individual functions/classes
- High coverage, low cost

**Integration Tests (Middle):**
- 15-20% of tests
- Seconds execution
- Test component interactions
- Database, API, services

**E2E Tests (Top):**
- 5-10% of tests
- Minutes execution
- Test critical user journeys
- Full stack, realistic scenarios

**Shift-Left Impact:**
Most testing happens at UNIT level (early, cheap, fast).

## Shift-Left Practices

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Process:**
```javascript
// 1. RED: Write failing test
test('validates email format', () => {
  expect(isValidEmail('invalid')).toBe(false);
  expect(isValidEmail('user@example.com')).toBe(true);
});

// 2. GREEN: Minimal implementation
function isValidEmail(email) {
  return email.includes('@');  // Simple, passes test
}

// 3. REFACTOR: Improve implementation
function isValidEmail(email) {
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return regex.test(email);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Better design (testable by default)
- Complete test coverage
- Confident refactoring
- Living documentation

---

### 2. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

**Process:**
```gherkin
# Business writes this (executable spec)
Feature: User Registration

Scenario: New user signs up successfully
  Given I am on the registration page
  When I enter valid email "user@example.com"
  And I enter password "SecurePass123"
  And I click "Sign Up"
  Then I should see "Welcome"
  And I should receive a confirmation email
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Developer implements step definitions
Given('I am on the registration page', async () => {
  await page.goto('/register');
});

When('I enter valid email {string}', async (email: string) => {
  await page.fill('[data-test=email]', email);
});

// ... more step definitions
```

**Benefits:**
- Shared language (business + dev)
- Testable requirements
- Automated acceptance tests
- Reduced misunderstandings

---

### 3. Design for Testability

**Principles:**

**a) Dependency Injection**
```typescript
// ❌ Hard to test (tight coupling)
class UserService {
  async createUser(data) {
    const db = new Database(); // Hard-coded dependency
    return db.insert('users', data);
  }
}

// ✅ Easy to test (loose coupling)
class UserService {
  constructor(private db: Database) {}

  async createUser(data) {
    return this.db.insert('users', data);
  }
}

// Test with mock
const mockDb = { insert: jest.fn() };
const service = new UserService(mockDb);
```

**b) Pure Functions**
```typescript
// ❌ Hard to test (side effects, global state)
let total = 0;
function addToTotal(amount) {
  total += amount;  // Modifies global state
  return total;
}

// ✅ Easy to test (pure, no side effects)
function calculateTotal(current, amount) {
  return current + amount;
}

test('adds amounts correctly', () => {
  expect(calculateTotal(100, 50)).toBe(150);
  expect(calculateTotal(0, 10)).toBe(10);
});
```

**c) Single Responsibility**
```typescript
// ❌ Hard to test (multiple responsibilities)
class OrderProcessor {
  processOrder(order) {
    this.validateOrder(order);
    this.chargePayment(order);
    this.sendEmail(order);
    this.updateInventory(order);
    // Too many responsibilities!
  }
}

// ✅ Easy to test (single responsibility)
class OrderValidator {
  validate(order) { /* ... */ }
}

class PaymentService {
  charge(order) { /* ... */ }
}

class EmailService {
  sendConfirmation(order) { /* ... */ }
}

// Each class has one reason to change, one thing to test
```

## Shift-Left Metrics

**Track Effectiveness:**

**1. Defect Detection Percentage (DDP)**
```
DDP = (Defects found in phase / Total defects) × 100

Target: 80%+ defects found before production
```

**2. Test Coverage**
```
Coverage = (Lines covered / Total lines) × 100

Target: 80%+ for unit tests
```

**3. Time to Feedback**
```
Feedback Time = Time from commit to test results

Target: < 10 minutes for unit tests
        < 30 minutes for integration tests
        < 60 minutes for E2E tests
```

**4. Cost of Defects**
```
Track cost by phase discovered:
- Requirements: $1-10
- Development: $100-1,000
- QA: $1,000-10,000
- Production: $10,000-100,000+
```

## Remember

**The earlier you find bugs, the cheaper they are to fix.**

**Cost by Phase:**
- Design/Requirements: $1-10
- Development (unit tests): $100-1,000
- QA/Integration: $1,000-10,000
- Production: $10,000-100,000+

**Shift-Left = 10x-100x cost reduction**

**Best Practices:**
1. Write tests BEFORE code (TDD)
2. Make requirements testable (BDD)
3. Design for testability (DI, pure functions)
4. Automate everything (CI/CD)
5. Fail fast (run fastest tests first)
6. Test pyramid (many unit, few E2E)

**With Agents:** `qe-test-generator` automatically generates shift-left tests (unit, integration) during development. `qe-regression-risk-analyzer` selects which tests to run based on code changes. Together, they enable true shift-left automation with minimal developer effort.
