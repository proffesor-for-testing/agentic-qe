# Mutation Testing

## Core Principle

**Tests test code. But who tests the tests?**

Mutation testing validates test quality by introducing small code changes (mutations) and verifying tests catch them. High mutation score = effective tests.

## What is Mutation Testing?

**Process:**
1. Mutate code (change + to -, < to <=, remove if statements)
2. Run tests against mutated code
3. If tests fail → Mutation "killed" ✅ (good)
4. If tests pass → Mutation "survived" ❌ (weak tests)

**Mutation Score = Killed / (Killed + Survived)**

**Example:**
```javascript
// Original code
function isAdult(age) {
  return age >= 18; // ← Mutation: Change >= to >
}

// Test
test('18 is adult', () => {
  expect(isAdult(18)).toBe(true); // Catches mutation!
});
```

**If test was weak:**
```javascript
test('19 is adult', () => {
  expect(isAdult(19)).toBe(true); // Doesn't catch >= vs >
});
// Mutation survives → Test needs improvement
```

## Mutation Operators

**Arithmetic:** `+ → -`, `* → /`
**Relational:** `< → <=`, `== → !=`
**Logical:** `&& → ||`, `! removed`
**Conditional:** `if (x) → if (true)`, `if (x) → if (false)`
**Statement:** Remove return, remove function call

## Using Stryker

**Install:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/core @stryker-mutator/jest-runner
npx stryker init
```

**Configuration:**
```javascript
// stryker.conf.json
{
  "packageManager": "npm",
  "reporters": ["html", "clear-text", "progress"],
  "testRunner": "jest",
  "coverageAnalysis": "perTest",
  "mutate": [
    "src/**/*.ts",
    "!src/**/*.spec.ts"
  ],
  "thresholds": {
    "high": 90,
    "low": 70,
    "break": 60
  }
}
```

**Run:**
```bash
npx stryker run
```

**Output:**
```
Mutation Score: 87.3%
Killed: 124
Survived: 18
No Coverage: 3
Timeout: 1
```

## With Agents

```typescript
// qe-test-generator uses mutation testing
const mutationAnalysis = await agent.analyzeMutations({
  targetFile: 'src/payment.ts',
  generateMissingTests: true
});

// Returns:
// {
//   mutationScore: 0.65,
//   survivedMutations: [
//     { line: 45, operator: '>=', mutant: '>', killedBy: null }
//   ],
//   generatedTests: [
//     'test for boundary at line 45'
//   ]
// }
```

## Remember

**High code coverage ≠ good tests**

- 100% coverage but weak assertions = useless
- Mutation testing proves tests work

**With Agents:** Mutation testing handler automatically runs mutations, identifies weak tests, and generates missing test cases to kill surviving mutations.
