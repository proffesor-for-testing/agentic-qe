**Breaking the Iron Triangle: How Agentic Quality Engineering Delivers Value at Speed, Scale, and Volume**

## Abstract

When Henry Ford asked customers what they wanted, they said "faster horses." A century later, manufacturing faces a similar trap: organizations are using AI to generate more tests, faster—but more volume without more value is just a faster horse.

The triple constraint has haunted manufacturing for decades: Speed, Cost, or Quality—pick two. Quality Engineering inherited this curse. The 2026 State of Testing Report confirms what practitioners have known for years: 70% of testing capacity is consumed by testing-related activities, while only 30% is devoted to testing that actually creates value. We've industrialized the clerical work of testing while starving its intellectual core.

Consider what that 70% actually looks like: writing and formatting bug reports, managing incident queues, preparing and maintaining test data, setting up and tearing down environments, documenting test evidence for compliance, maintaining regression suites against changing requirements, triaging flaky tests, and generating status reports no one reads. These are necessary activities—but they are not where quality is created. Quality is created when a tester spots a risk no one else considered, when domain expertise reveals a failure mode the specification missed, when critical evaluation prevents a dangerous defect from reaching production.

Now AI promises to solve this—and most organizations are getting it catastrophically wrong. They're using AI to accelerate the 70% (more test cases, faster execution, bigger reports) while the 30% that matters remains unchanged. 76.8% have adopted AI in testing, yet only 4.5% measure customer impact. That's not transformation. That's automation of waste at scale.

Agentic Quality Engineering breaks the triple constraint—not by replacing testers, but by fundamentally amplifying them. AI agents handle the clerical burden: they auto-triage incidents with root cause correlation, generate production-realistic test data on demand, maintain living documentation as a byproduct of reasoning, and keep regression suites aligned to actual risk. But the real transformation is what agents give back to human testers: deep domain context synthesised from thousands of production incidents, industry-specific failure pattern recognition that would take a human months to accumulate, technical depth across system boundaries that no single tester can hold in their head, and real-time risk intelligence drawn from production telemetry, change velocity, and historical defect patterns. All of this at hyper execution speed and depth.

The result is not testers replaced by machines. It is testers who understand their system more deeply, identify risks more precisely, and make decisions more confidently—because AI agents provide the breadth of knowledge and speed of analysis that human cognition alone cannot sustain across today's complex  systems.

This talk presents a philosophy, a framework, and technical foundation for industries that are ready to stop building faster horses—and start creating value at the speed, scale, and volume their digital transformation demands.

**The question isn't "Can AI generate more tests and automate faster?" It's "How AI can transform Quality Engineering that delivers value at higher speed, scale and minimal costs"**

## Short Abstract (100 words)

Manufacturing's triple constraint—speed, cost, or quality, pick two—has haunted Quality Engineering for decades. 70% of testing capacity is consumed by clerical work: bug reporting, test data prep, incident management, environment setup. AI agents handle this burden while giving testers something more powerful: synthesised domain knowledge, cross-system failure pattern recognition, and real-time risk intelligence no human could accumulate alone.

Agentic QE doesn't replace testers—it amplifies them. Faster decisions, deeper insights, more intelligent risk identification. This keynote presents the philosophy, framework, and architecture for human-agent collaboration that delivers value at speed, scale, and volume.
